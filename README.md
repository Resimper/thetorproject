# thetorproject

The Tor Project, short for The Onion Router, is a non-profit organization that develops and maintains the Tor anonymity network. Tor is designed to enhance privacy and security on the internet by allowing users to browse the web anonymously and access blocked content. It achieves this through a combination of encryption and a distributed network of volunteer-operated servers.
